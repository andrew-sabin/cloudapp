# cloudapp
Portfolio Project For Cloud Application Development at Oregon State University

# Full Description
Created a server application where users can create, read, update, and delete different different boats and floats. 

It checks to make sure that each boat and float is created by the specific user by making sure that the JWT matches the user with their specific float and boat.

The application is hosted on Google Cloud Services.

# Postman Tests

Due to the application being server only, I used Post-man tests to test for issues that might occur with the application.
